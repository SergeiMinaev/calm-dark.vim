Minimalistic dark color scheme for Vim. It highlights only function/class/method names and comments. At first it feels weird but after a while you will find how cool it is.

Garland-like syntax highlighting creates a false sense of convenience and in fact does not help in any way.
In my opinion, the point of syntax highlighting is to help your eyes quickly find the right parts of the code.
Highlighting each word in a different color does not help with this and simply creates a multicolored mess.
What can possibly help is to leave quotes, numbers etc. alone and to highlight only what is necessary - a function names.
You can look at this as the table of contents of a book - a function name is like a title of a chapter.
Comments are not part of the code so it's good to mute them a bit.

This scheme requires special syntax files to be able to highlight function names, so it is suggested that it will be used together with this vim configuration - https://github.com/SergeiMinaev/vim-config .
Or you can download the syntax files manually from https://github.com/SergeiMinaev/vim-config/tree/master/syntax .
